# Vollmed API
Project developed based on the Alura Spring Boot Course
- During this course, I created a REST API using Spring Boot and also developed a CRUD.
- I learned what Spring Boot is and what its main differences are compared to traditional Spring. I used Spring Initializr to build my project.
- I understood how the directory structure works and the "pom.xml" file. I learned to use some of its modules, such as Web, Validation, and Spring Data JPA.
- I used other libraries, such as the MySQL driver, Flyway, and Lombok. I also learned how configurations work in a Spring Boot project.
- I learned how to perform migrations to control the database's evolution history and how to implement the REST API from creating the controllers. I also learned to use repositories to simplify database access and JPA.
- I mapped JPA entities and implemented CRUD with validations.
